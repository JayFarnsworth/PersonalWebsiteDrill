            Jay grew up in the beautiful idealistic bubble of Boulder, Colorado. There he discovered his passion for the outdoors and live music. He enjoys exploring out of the way parts of the state. His musical taste varies from funk to bluegrass to deep house, inspired by the many varieties of music subcultures available around Colorado. He also enjoys exploring open scenic backroads around the front range in his E30 that’s being restored progressively.

          Jay studied Political Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder, graduating in the Summer of 2015. Despite the drastic change of industry to web development in 2017, he remains passionate about American Politics.<br /><br /> He is eagerly awaiting the collapse of polarized hateful two-party politics in Washington. He is shocked that we remain the most incarcerated nation on earth by a wide margin. He firmly believes that progressive drug policies are on the right side of history, and that the legalization of marijuana is the beginning of a move away from decades of unethical drug policy in America.

          Jay began Galvanize’s Immersive Web Development Program in the fall of 2017, after a summer of exploring Javascript and Python. After working in Sales at two tech companies, he decided that building things is far more rewarding than selling snake oil. He’s enthusiastically soaking up every concept possible during long days and often nights wrestling with new languages and concepts.
