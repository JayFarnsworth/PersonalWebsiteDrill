      <h1>Meet-ups</h1>
      <h4>As part of my Galvanize education, I'll be frequently attending meetups in the tech community. I'll reflect on these below:</h4>
      <h5>The Algorithmic Economy with Brian Anderson - November 7th, 2017</h5>
      <p>
        I attended this meetup in the evening after class at Pivotal on the second floor of Galvanize’s building. It was interesting to hang out in Pivotal, you can make a lot of assumptions about a company’s culture from simply being in their space.<br /><br />

I chatted briefly with the main speaker, Brian Anderson. He is the Global Business Development Executive at Tibco Software. I also spoke with Ward Maddux, who organized the event. He is the Product Manager at Pivotal, focusing on their data platform and integrations.<br /><br />

Overall, Brian was energetic about the subject matter, but was a little dull in his delivery. Perhaps my view of this was jaded by my lack of knowledge of big data systems. Much of the talk went right over my head. He referenced two examples that were particularly interesting: University of Iowa using data algorithms to improve post-surgery patient outcomes. This integration has reduced infection by 60 percent, improving patient outcomes, and saving the hospital money. He also discussed commercial airline tracking and modeling, although the main point of this example went over my head as well. It was very complex information. After the talk some of the audience members had some pointed questions, which leads me to believe it was my lack of fundamental understanding of these topics that led to my confusion during sections of his talk. He touched on the drastic increase in the number of apps that are cranked out by a company such as Amazon, from 20 or so a day to now a new app every few seconds. He said this is made possible by the growth of low-code or no-code methods, which he predicted would represent 50% of all new apps in three years. I wished he would have gone into more detail on this. <br /><br />

Questions I had after attending this meetup-<br /><br />
What is a “low-code” or “no-code” app, and how will this affect the need for programmers in the future?<br /><br /><br /><br />

      <h5>Open Source Operating Systems, Android - November 10th, 2017</h5>
      <p>
        My classmate Dan Beerman is one of the co-sponsors of this group. On his recommendation, I attended despite the assumption that all of this material would soar far over my head. I was not wrong. A group of about 15 of us nestled into classroom 2 in the Galvanize basement. The subject was Android OS. The most vocal members of this group were easily 10+ years into their development careers. All unabashed nerds, these guys opened their firehose of technobabble and did not stop. It was like an episode of Star Trek with Scotty and Spock discussing the current problem plaguing the Enterprise, but without Kirk mercifully interjecting at the end with a simple analogy like “It’s like jumpstarting a car!” <br /><br />

The “panel” began their presentation by booting up androids CLI interface on a screen, and looking through the root folder. This is the end of where I am able to describe what was happening on screen. There was a constant flow of CLI logs flowing across the screen. Many of them were errors, which was reassuring to see in a complete released OS. There was a constant stream of swearing, peanut gallery interjections, and jokes that landed with everyone but me and my fellow programming rookies.<br /><br />

My main takeaway from the two hours I spent in the Galvanize basement with these walking cartoon characters of Android developers is a firmer grasp of programer culture. Despite not gleaning hardly any real technical insights, spending time in this environment and listening to geeks talking shop is interesting for me as someone just now learning programmer culture. The guys were an absolute riot, and clearly were extremely knowledgeable about what they do. I did not get contact information from the two main guys, but I did remember that they worked for Mersive as developers. <br /><br />

Questions after attending this meetup:<br />
-Why are open source OS’ so popular among the developer community? What advantages are there to an open source os vs a heavily modded version of a more traditional OS?<br />
-Will a traditional OS log a ton of errors in the console as part of normal operating?<br /><br /><br /><br />

    <h1><br />Learning To Learn</h1>
    <h4>Here I'll outline the process by which I'm engaging my brain with new concepts</h4>
    <h5>Wrestling with Nested "For" Loops</h5>
    <p>
      I’ve been struggling with several javascript concepts for a few days- namely what to do when a function takes several complex arguments- For example, an array of stuff also containing arrays. I had no idea how to reference the values in these arrays within arrays, among other things. Upon looking into some problem solutions I discovered that nested for loops were my answer. Having already struggled with basic for loops, I decided I needed to actively learn how to properly execute them. <br /><br />

	As for most people, I typically have a lot open on my computer at any given moment. To “set the stage” I closed out my messenger, slack, and music apps. I closed out any non-relevant tabs from my browser. To keep me from being distracted by outside noise, I put on some white noise in my headphones.<br /><br />

	I dove into the material. I was working on a codewars problem, which was what initially made me need to learn this material, so I kept the problem solution in mind while learning. I re-read the galvanize-learn page about for loops. I had created a nested for loop with Kim during a breakout, but I had no idea what it meant when I copied her code. I pulled up that file, and keeping in mind the specific functions of each part of the code, tried to guide myself through the execution of the code piece by piece. Something eventually jumped out at me- I wasn’t constructing the loop right at all. Despite having two loops (one referencing “i” and one referencing “j”, but my second loop wasn’t making a reference to the “i” position, and therefore was pretty useless. I wrote a “console.log” between the first and second loops to be able to better understand the inputs as they change. I messed around with the code a bunch to try to get better acquainted with how they work. Changing my statement to be executed after the loop some, I got some weird results, and some infinite loops that I had to cancel.<br /><br />

	Having really taken some time to isolate for loops and understand how they work was paramount to my understanding of the concept, and my grasping of more complex js functions as a whole. Eliminating distractions helped me stay focused, as for me it is easy to take a break every few minutes when I’m wrestling with something I don’t understand- it’s a poisonous form of procrastination for me, and a thief of time. <br /><br />

	I’m still scratching the surface of for loops and nested for loops, but now that I can execute a basic one, more complex javascript material is available to me. I did end up completing my code wars problem, which was my original goal. I’m able to work on exercises that are a whole level higher since this learning, which is a huge victory for me.<br /><br /><br />

    <h1><br />Daily Goal Setting</h1>
    <h4>Teaching Myself to Set Daily Objectives is Crucial for Keeping Myself On Task. I'll List These Below:</h4>
    <h5>Goals For November 6th, 2017</h5>
    <p>
      --Begin goal setting and learning to learn soft skills<br />
--Set calendar events for two meetups to attend this week<br />
--Gain a firm understanding of arguments in javascript functions and how to reference complex arguments in a function.<br />
--Submit JS drills 1 and 2<br/><br/>

I met nearly all of my goals today. I’ve been behind on my soft skills assessments, so starting those is satisfying. I calendered two meetups as well. I spent a significant portion of my afternoon learning about complex arguments in a function- I actually discovered that it was nested for loops that I was having trouble grasping. I firmly understand them now. I did not submit JS drill 2- it is completed but I am having a phantom error on the test that I’m struggling with despite my code working as intended. I need help from someone tomorrow figuring that out in order to submit the drill. <br/><br/>

	Despite not submitting JS drill 2, I’d consider this item in my goals list to be a success. I’ve been learning Javascript on my own over the last few days, and simply jumping in and starting these drills feels good. I’m far further along in learning javascript than I thought. In the same vein, figuring out nested for loops was a win for me. Sometimes I’ll lack understanding of a basic JS concept and will learn everything but that one concept in order to avoid frustration. Tackling it head on by identifying a specific problem I’m having was a great way to advance my JS knowledge.<br/><br/>

	While putting meetups on my calendar this week was a win, I still feel I’m kicking the can down the road for later. There were meetups I could have attended tonight, but I chose more desirable sounding ones later in the week.<br/><br/>

	Tomorrow, I will identify another big JS concept I don’t understand to work through. However, I’m going to focus on more work that has definite ending points -- i.e. submit drills.<br/><br/>

    </p>

    <h5>Goals For November 7th, 2017</h5>
    <p>
      --Submit one L2L assessment<br />
      --Submit all JS money assessments <br />
      --Finally submit a passing version of building basic websites “c” (4th attempt)<br />
      --Build a framework for the personal website project<br />
      --Learn and add at least 3 array control methods to my personal wiki<br /><br />

      	I did submit a revised version of my basic website drill 3. I also completed a L2L and submitted all of my JS money assessments. The problem I was having with them was bigger than I expected, so I’m happy to have figured out that. The more experience I have fixing broken JS, the better programmer I become. I added the .push .splice and .slice methods to my personal wiki, and in doing so I feel I got a better grasp on exactly what they do, I consider it a win.<br/><br/>

      	Breaking up my day into a few different topics made me feel I focused on what I was working on more so than powering through one topic exclusively all day. <br/><br/>

      	I did not find time to begin my personal website. I’m moving this to my goals for tomorrow. I had time I could have easily done this, but I chose to spend a couple hours messing around with codewars problems. <br/><br/>

      	Tomorrow I’m going to knock out my soft skills stuff in the morning and work on less structured learning in the afternoon. <br/><br/><br />

    </p>
    <img src='images/redpagebreak.png' />

    <h5>Goals for November 8th, 2018</h5>
    <p>
--Submit another L2L drill<br/>
--Build the basic framework of my personal website project<br/>
--Turn in my reflection from the meetup I attended last night<br/>
--Start reading through the material for servers<br/><br />

	I spent a majority of the day putting my personal website together, which took longer than I expected. Servers proved to be a nightmare without instruction. Other than that I did not get to a L2L which was something I really wanted to get done. <br/><br/>

	I found my day is significantly less productive when I attend a bunch of breakouts, which means I have to be even more efficient with the free time I do have during the day. <br/><br/>

	I absolutely need to complete my L2Ls before the end of the week. It will be a my main focus tomorrow.<br/><br/>
